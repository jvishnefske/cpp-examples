# This currently does nothing

I have a dream of running a simple web based team development environment. Currently considering using docker compose.

## Future consideration

- central user administration
- use existing docker images wherever posible
- consider backup strategies for docker volumes (tarball?)
- make it easy to start a new environment with minimal environment variables.
- provide sane defaults.
